Characters have a limit of up to 6 corruption stacks of a given type before becoming (on the 7th or higher) corrupted. Characters receive one more corruption stack from glyphs of the type they are not attuned with. Characters may choose day or night attunement upon receiving their first glyph, this attunement may not be revisited.Â  Attunement is represented by a colored circle at the center of the arm associated with the alignement. 

Corruption manifests in the form of marks similar to tattoos on the right arm with dark red colors for day corruption 
and on the left arm with a light blue color for night corruption.

Whenever a character gains Day corruption they feel a burning sensation.
Whenever a character gains Night corruption they feel a biting cold sensation.

Corrupted Characters may not use more glyphs of any alignment and suffer from sudden bouts of pain and muscular contractions semi-periodically (up to the DM to decide intervals). The DM may have this take the form of skipping a turn in combat or another disadvantageous situation.

Characters attempting to rest while suffering from corruption have to roll a constitution saving throw DC 5 + 1 per corruption stack, on fail the character fails to rest because of convulsions and pain.
