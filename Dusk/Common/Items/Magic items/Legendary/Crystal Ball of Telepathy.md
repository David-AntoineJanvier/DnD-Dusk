_Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)_

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast [Scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619007-scrying) (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You can also cast [Suggestion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619101-suggestion) (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don’t need to concentrate on this _Suggestion_ to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if _Scrying_ ends. You can’t cast _Suggestion_ in this way again until the next dawn.
