_Weapon (Maul or Warhammer), Legendary (Requires Attunement)_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The weapon has 5 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the weapon, hurling it as if it had the [Thrown](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown) property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the weapon unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [Stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition until the end of your next turn. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand. The weapon regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

**_Giant’s Bane._** While you are attuned to the weapon and wearing either a [Belt of Giant Strength](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5372-belt-of-giant-strength) or [Gauntlets of Ogre Power](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4641-gauntlets-of-ogre-power) to which you are also attuned, you gain the following benefits:

**Giants’ Bane.** When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll made with this weapon against a Giant, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.

**Might of Giants.** The Strength score bestowed by your _Belt of Giant Strength_ or _Gauntlets of Ogre Power_ increases by 4, to a maximum of 30.
