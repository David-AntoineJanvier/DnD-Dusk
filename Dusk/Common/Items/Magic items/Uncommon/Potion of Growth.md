_Potion, Uncommon_

When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the [Enlarge/Reduce](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619170-enlarge-reduce) spell for 10 minutes (no [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) required).

The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
