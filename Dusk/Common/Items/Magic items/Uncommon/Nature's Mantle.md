_Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Druid or Ranger)_

This cloak shifts color and texture to blend with the terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid and Ranger spells.

While you are in an area that is [Lightly Obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LightlyObscured), you can [Hide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HideAction) as a Bonus Action even if you are being directly observed.
