_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_

Found in a small container, this powder resembles [Dust of Disappearance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9228522-dust-of-disappearance), and [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619180-identify) reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

As a [Utilize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, you can throw the dust into the air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from you to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals, Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save automatically.

On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing uncontrollably; it has the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition and is [suffocating](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SuffocationHazard). The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends on any creature targeted by a [Lesser Restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619016-lesser-restoration) spell.
