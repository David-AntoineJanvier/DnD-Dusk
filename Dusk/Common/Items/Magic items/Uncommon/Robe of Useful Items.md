_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_

This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.
