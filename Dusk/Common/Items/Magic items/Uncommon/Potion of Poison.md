_Potion, Uncommon_

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a [Potion of Healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8960641-potion-of-healing) or another beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619180-identify) reveals its true nature.

If you drink this potion, you take 4d6 Poison damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition for 1 hour.
