_Potion, Uncommon_

When you drink this potion, you can cast the level 3 version of the [Animal Friendship](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618847-animal-friendship) spell (save DC 13).

Agitating this potion’s muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird feather, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.
