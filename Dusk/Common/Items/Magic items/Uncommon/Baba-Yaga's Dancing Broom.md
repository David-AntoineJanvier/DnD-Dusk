_Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)_

The archfey Baba Yaga crafted many of these magic brooms. No two appear exactly alike. While holding the broom, you can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to transform it into an [Animated Broom](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194894-animated-broom) under your control. The broom then moves into an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The broom acts immediately after you on your Initiative count and remains animate until you take a Bonus Action and use a command word to render it inanimate.

On your turn, you can mentally command the animated broom if it is within 30 feet of you and you don’t have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition (no action required). You decide what action the broom takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If the broom is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it shatters and is destroyed. If the broom reverts to its inanimate form before losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.
