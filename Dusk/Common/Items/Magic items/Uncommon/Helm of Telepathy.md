_Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)_

While wearing this helm, you have telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and you can cast [Detect Thoughts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619099-detect-thoughts) or [Suggestion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619101-suggestion) (save DC 13) from the helm. Once either spell is cast from the helm, that spell can’t be cast from it again until the next dawn.
