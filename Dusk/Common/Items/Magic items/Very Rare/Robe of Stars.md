_Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)_

This black or dark-blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.

Six stars, located on the robe’s upper-front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to remove one of the stars and expend it to cast the level 5 version of [Magic Missile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619022-magic-missile). Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.

While you wear the robe, you can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied or, if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.
