_Ring, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)_

You can cast [Dancing Lights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619058-dancing-lights) or [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618996-light) from the ring.

The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges to use the properties below.

**_Faerie Fire._** You can expend 1 charge to cast [Faerie Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618858-faerie-fire) from the ring.

**_Lightning Spheres._** You can expend 2 charges as a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds [Dim Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) in a 30-foot radius.

As a Bonus Action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn’t behind [Total Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover), the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

|Number of Spheres|Lightning Damage|
|---|---|
|1|4d12|
|2|5d4|
|3|2d6|
|4|2d4|

**_Shooting Stars._** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each creature in a 15-foot [Cube](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) originating from that point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
