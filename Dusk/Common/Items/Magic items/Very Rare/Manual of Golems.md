_Wondrous Item, Very Rare_

This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The DM chooses the type or determines it randomly by rolling on the accompanying table. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two level 5 spell slots. A creature that can’t use a _Manual of Golems_ and attempts to read it takes 6d6 Psychic damage.

To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.

Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. See the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024) for the golem’s stat block. The golem is under your control, and it understands and obeys your commands.
