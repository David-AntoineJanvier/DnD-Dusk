_Weapon (Quarterstaff), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)_

You have a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

While holding this weapon, you can cause it to emit green [Dim Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) out to 10 feet, either as a Bonus Action or after you roll Initiative, or you can extinguish the light as a Bonus Action.

While holding this weapon, you can take a Bonus Action to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch rod (for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it a Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows.

In certain forms, the weapon has the following additional properties.

**_Acrobatic Assist (Quarterstaff and 10-Foot Pole Forms Only)._** While holding this weapon, you have Advantage on Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks.

**_Attack Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only)._** When you are hit by an attack while holding the weapon, you can take a Reaction to twirl the weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your Armor Class against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You can’t use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

**_Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only)._** This weapon has the [Thrown](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown) property with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the weapon, it flies back to your hand.
