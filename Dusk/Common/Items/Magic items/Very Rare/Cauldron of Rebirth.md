_Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Druid or Warlock)_

This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast-iron sides.

You can use the cauldron as a Spellcasting Focus for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the [Scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619007-scrying) spell.

**_Brew Potion._** When you finish a Long Rest, you can use the cauldron to create a [Potion of Healing (greater)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5133-potion-of-healing-greater), which takes 1 minute. The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.

**_Raise Dead._** As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, harmlessly shunting anything that can’t fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.

If you place the corpse of a Humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 GP) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by [Raise Dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618922-raise-dead) at the next dawn. Once used, this property can’t be used again for 7 days.
