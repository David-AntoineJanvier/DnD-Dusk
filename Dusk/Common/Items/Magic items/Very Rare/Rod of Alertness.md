**_Spells._** While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:

- [Detect Evil and Good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619090-detect-evil-and-good)
- [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic)

- [See Invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619011-see-invisibility)

**_Protective Aura._** As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds [Bright Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 60-foot radius and [Dim Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 60 feet. While in that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can sense the location of any [Invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) creature that is also in the Bright Light.

The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
