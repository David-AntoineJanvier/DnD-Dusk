_Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Wizard)_

This pointed hat has the following properties.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** While holding the hat, you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells. Any spell you cast using the hat gains a special Somatic component: you must reach into the hat and “pull” the spell out of it.

**_Unknown Spell._** While holding the hat, you can try to cast a level 1+ spell you don’t know. The spell must be on the Wizard spell list, it must be of a level you can cast, and it can’t have Material components costing more than 1,000 GP. Once you decide on the spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell’s level. Then, to determine whether you cast the spell, make an Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check (DC 10 plus the spell’s level). On a successful check, you cast the spell using its normal casting time, and you can’t use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. On a failed check, you fail to cast the spell and a random effect occurs instead, determined by rolling on the following table.

Any spell you cast from the hat uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
