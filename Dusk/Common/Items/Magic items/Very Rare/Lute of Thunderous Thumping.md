_Weapon (Club), Very Rare_

This reinforced lute can be wielded as a magic Club that deals an extra 2d8 Thunder damage on a hit.

**_Sing and Swing._** If you’re a Bard, you can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier when making a melee attack roll with the lute, provided you sing or hum while making the attack.
