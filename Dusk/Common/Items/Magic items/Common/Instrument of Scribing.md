_Wondrous Item, Common_

This musical instrument has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While you are playing it, you can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to expend 1 charge and write a magical message on a nonmagical object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The message can be up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a Bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical [Darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness). Casting the [Dispel Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619103-dispel-magic) spell on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours.
