_Wondrous Item, Common_
#Common_MI 

If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an [Awakened Shrub](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194905-awakened-shrub) at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.

The awakened shrub is [Friendly](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FriendlyAttitude) toward you and obeys your commands. Absent commands from you, it does nothing.
