_Wondrous Item, Common_
#Common_MI 

This copper amulet contains tiny interlocking gears and is powered by magic from [Mechanus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/cosmology#Mechanus), a plane of clockwork predictability. Faint ticking and whirring noises emanate from within.

When you make an attack roll while wearing the amulet, you can forgo rolling the d20 to get a 10 on the die. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
